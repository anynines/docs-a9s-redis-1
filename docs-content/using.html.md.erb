This topic describes how to use a9s Redis.


## <a id='use-a9s-redis-with-an-application'></a> Use a9s Redis with an Application

To use a9s Redis with an application, create a service instance and bind the service instance to your app. For more information about managing service instances, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

### <a id='view-the-a9s-redis-service'></a> View the a9s Redis Service

After the tile is installed, you can see the `a9s-redis32` and its service plans appear in your CF marketplace. Run `cf marketplace` to see the service listing:

´´´bash
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org test / space test as admin...
OK
service        plans                                                                           description
a9s-redis32    redis-single-small, redis-single-big, redis-cluster-small, redis-cluster-big    This is the anynines Redis 32 service.
´´´

### <a id='create-a-service-instance'></a> Create a Service Instance

To provision a Redis database, run `cf create-service`.

´´´bash
$ cf create-service a9s-redis32 redis-single-small my-redis-service
´´´

Depending on your infrastructure and service broker utilization, it might take several minutes to create the service instance.

Run `cf services` to view the creation status. This command displays a list of all your service instances. To view the status of a specific service instance, run `cf service NAME-OF-YOUR-SERVICE`.

### <a id='bind-an-application-to-a-service-instance'></a> Bind an Application to a Service Instance

After your database is created, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to your application:

´´´bash
$ cf bind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
´´´

### <a id='restage-or-restart-your-application'></a> Restage or Restart Your Application

To enable your application to access the service instance, run `cf restage` or `cf restart` to restage or restart your application.

### <a id='obtain-service-instance-access-credentials'></a> Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials

After a service instance is bound to an application, the credentials of your Redis database are stored in the environment variables of the application. Run `cf env APP-NAME` to display the environment variables.

You can find the credentials in the [VCAP_SERVICES](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) key.

´´´bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "a9s-redis": [
   {
    "credentials": {
      "dns_servers": [
        "172.28.10.22",
        "172.28.11.11",
        "172.28.12.11"
      ],
      "host": [
        "d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs"
      ],
      "host_ip": [
        "172.28.25.12"
      ],
      "port": 6379
      "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
      "username": "a9s-password"
    },
    "label": "a9s-redis",
    "name": "my-redis-service",
    "plan": "redis-single-non-persistent-small",
   }
  ]
 }
}
...
´´´

You can use the host_ip, username, and password values to connect to your database with a Redis client.

a9s Redis for PCF comes with its own Consul cluster to provide hostname resolving. When your DNS is configured to resolve the a9s Redis for PCF service instance domains, you can make use of `host`. For more information, see [Name Resolving With Consul](./installing.html#name-resolving-with-consul).


## <a id='delete-an-a9s-redis-service-instance'></a> Delete an a9s Redis Service Instance

<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING:</strong> Before deleting a service instance, you must back up data stored in your database. This operation cannot be undone and all the data is lost when the service is deleted.</p>

Before you can delete a service instance, you must unbind it from all apps.

### <a id='list-available-services'></a> List Available Services

Run `cf services` to list available services.

´´´bash
$ cf services

Getting services in org test / space test as admin...
OK

name                 service       plan                   bound apps        last operation
my-redis-service     a9s-redis     redis-single-small     a9s-redis-app     create succeeded
´´´

This example shows that `my-redis-service` is bound to the `a9s-redis-app` application.

### <a id='unbind-a-service-instance'></a> Unbind a Service Instance

Run `cf unbind-service` to unbind the service from your app:

´´´bash
$ cf unbind-service a9s-redis-app my-redis-service
´´´

### <a id='delete-a-service-instance'></a> Delete a Service Instance

After unbinding the service, it is no longer bound to an app. Run `cf delete-service` to delete the service:

´´´bash
$ cf delete-service my-redis-service
´´´

It may take several minutes to delete the service. Deleting a service deprovisions the corresponding infrastructure resources.
Run the `cf services` command to view the deletion status.


## <a id='upgrade-the-service-instance-to-another-service-plan'></a> Upgrade the Service Instance to Another Service Plan

Once created, you can upgrade your service instance to another, larger service plan. A larger service plan provides more CPU, RAM and storage. For more information, see the  [Update a Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#update_service) of the _Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI_ topic.

´´´bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -p a-bigger-plan
´´´

Here are the plans you can upgrade to, depending on the one you are currently using:

| Base Plan | Target Plan |
|------|-----------|
| redis-single-nano | redis-single-small <br> redis-single-medium <br> redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-small <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-small | redis-single-medium <br> redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-small <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-medium | redis-single-big <br> redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-big | redis-cluster-big |
| redis-cluster-small | redis-cluster-medium <br> redis-cluster-big |
| redis-cluster-medium | redis-cluster-big |
| redis-single-nano-ssl | redis-single-small-ssl <br> redis-single-medium-ssl <br> redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-small-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-small-ssl | redis-single-medium-ssl <br> redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-small-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-medium-ssl | redis-single-big-ssl <br> redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-single-big-ssl | redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-cluster-small-ssl | redis-cluster-medium-ssl <br> redis-cluster-big-ssl |
| redis-cluster-medium-ssl | redis-cluster-big-ssl |


## <a id='change-rdb-persistence-settings'></a> Change RDB Persistence Settings

a9s Redis supports RDB persistence with point-in-time snapshots. This setting can be changed by the user.

### <a id='default-behavior'></a> Default Behavior

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |
| save 60 10000 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### <a id='configuring-rdb'></a> Configuring RDB
You can configure RDB according to the needs of your apps by providing customer settings. This setting must follow the original Redis configuration for RDB `-c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}`.

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "['save 900 1', 'save 300 10']"}
´´´

In this example, it is configured to snapshot the Redis database according to the following rules:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| save 900 1 | Create a snapshot after 900 seconds if 1 write operations occurred. |
| save 300 10 | Create a snapshot after 300 seconds if 10 write operations occurred. |

### <a id='cache-only'></a> Cache Only
You can disable snapshots and use Redis as cache only by creating the service with the following customer setting `-c '{"snapshot": "[]"}'`.

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"snapshot": "[]"}
´´´

For more information, see the snapshot settings in the documentation of [Redis Persistence](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).


## <a id='change-maxmemory-policy'></a> Change Maxmemory Policy

With the maxmemory\_policy, you can configure a9s Redis which key to remove when maxmemory is reached. Ther are several configurable behaviors. `noeviction` is the default.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| volatile-lru | Remove the key with an expire set using an LRU algorithm |
| allkeys-lru | Remove any key according to the LRU algorithm |
| volatile-random | Remove a random key with an expire set |
| allkeys-random | Remove any random key |
| volatile-ttl | Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL) |
| noeviction | Do not expire at all, just return an error on write operations |

You can use `-c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}` to update the maxmemory-policy.

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"maxmemory_policy": "volatile-ttl"}
´´´

For more information, see the maxmemory-policy settings in the self documented [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf).


## <a id='ha-cluster-with-redis-sentinel'></a> HA Cluster with Redis Sentinel

a9s Redis uses [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) to provide a high available replication set.
Redis Sentinel monitors the several nodes, takes care of automatic failover, and sends notifcation when something in the cluster changes.

a9s Redis provides two settings to adjust the cluster behaviour, `min_slaves_max_lag` and `down_after_milliseconds`.

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| min\_slaves\_max\_lag | Time in seconds the master waits before it stops accepting writes when slaves are no more reachable. Default is 10 seconds. min-slaves-to-write is set to 1 and cannot be changed. See [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/redis.conf). |
| down\_after\_milliseconds | Number of milliseconds the master should be unreachable in order to consider it in S_DOWN state. Default is 30000 ms. See [sentinel.conf](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/sentinel.conf). |

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"min_slaves_max_lag": "10"}
´´´

´´´bash
  $ cf update-service my-redis-service -c {"down_after_milliseconds": "30000"}
´´´


## <a id='add-a-graphite-endpoint'></a> Add a Graphite Endpoint

If you want to monitor your service with Graphite, you can set an endpoint to where to information will be sent with the `cf update-service` command. This command expects the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding) and a JSON string containing the `graphite` and `metrics_prefix` keys.
Depending on your graphite provider, the `metrics_prefix` might require that each metric must start with an API key in their name. You can also change the interval within the data is send to the endpoint. To do this, modify `interval`; the default is 10s.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -c '{ "graphite": ["yourspace.your-graphite-endpoint.com:12345"], "metrics_prefix": "your-api-key.my-cluster-redis", "interval": "5"}'
```


## <a id='add-a-syslog-endpoint'></a> Add a Syslog Endpoint

The `cf update-service` command used with the [-c flag](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-binding) can let you stream your syslog to a third-party service. In this case, the command expects a JSON string containing the `syslog` key. You can also change the interval for the syslog with the same key than for the graphite endpoint `interval`.

```bash
$ cf update-service my-redis-service -c '{ "syslog": ["logs4.your-syslog-endpoint.com:54321"], "interval": "5" }'
```


## <a id='cloud-foundry-application-security-groups'></a> Cloud Foundry Application Security Groups

This topic describes how to check whether a security group was created.

Each a9s Data Service will automatically create and update Cloud Foundry security groups in order to protect service instances to be accessed by applications not running in the same Cloud Foundry applications space.
To understand Security Groups, see [Understanding Application Security Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/asg.html).

### <a id='get-service-instance-guid'></a> Get Service Instance GUID

Run `cf service INSTANCE_NAME --guid` to get the guid of the service instance.

```bash
$ cf service my-redis --guid
ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028
```

### <a id='check-available-security-groups'></a> Check Available Security Groups

To see all available security groups, run `cf security-groups`.

```
$cf security-groups
Getting security groups as demo@anynines.com
OK

     Name                                         Organization     Space
#0   public_networks
#1   dns
#2   tcp_open
#3   guard_432fb752-876d-443b-a311-a075f4df2237   demonstrations   demo
#4   guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028   demonstrations   demo
```

There we can see a security group with the named `guard_ca16f111-5073-40b7-973a-156c75dd3028`
was successfully created.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> In some circumstances, the connection between the application and the service instance is not possible. In this case, check to see if a security group was created.</p>


## <a id='backup-and-restore-service-instances'></a> Back Up and Restore Service Instances

a9s Redis provides an easy way to create backups and restore if needed.
For a more detailed description see the [a9s Service Dashboard](a9s-service-dashboard.html) documentation.

## <a id='make-a-service-instance-locally-available'></a> Make a Service Instance Locally Available

It is possible to access any of the a9s Data Services locally. You can connect with a local client to the service for any purpose, such as debugging.
CF provides a smart way to create SSH forward tunnels through a pushed application.
For more information about this feature, see the [Accessing Apps with SSH](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html) section of the CF documentation.

First, you must have an application bound to the service. To do this, see [Bind an Application to a Service Instance](#bind-an-application-to-a-service-instance).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> `cf ssh` support must be enabled in the platform. Your administrator can tell you whether it is enabled.</p>

### <a id='get-the-service-url-and-credentials'></a> Get the Service URL and Credentials

You must first follow the procedure in [Obtain Service Instance Access Credentials](#obtain-service-instance-access-credentials) to get the hostname of the service and the user credentials.

```bash
$ cf env a9s-redis-app
Getting env variables for app a9s-redis-app in org test / space test as admin...
OK

System-Provided:
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
   "a9s-redis": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "dns_servers": [
          "172.28.10.22",
          "172.28.11.11",
          "172.28.12.11"
        ],
        "host": [
          "d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs"
        ],
        "host_ip": [
          "172.28.25.12"
        ],
        "port": 6379
        "password": "a9s-brk-usr",
        "username": "a9s-password"
     },
     "label": "a9s-redis",
     "name": "my-redis-service",
     "plan": "redis-cluster-small"
    }
   ]
  }
}
...
```

Note the host `d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs`, the username `a9s-brk-usr`, and the password `a9s-password`. You will need these in the next step.

### <a id='create-a-tunnel-to-the-service'></a> Create a Tunnel to the Service

With `cf ssh`,  you can create am SSH forward tunnel to the management dashboard.
Use port `6379` to connect to the a9s Redis Instance.

```bash
$ cf ssh a9s-redis-app -L 6379:d67901c.service.dc1.a9svs:6379
vcap@956aaf4e-6da9-4f69-4b1d-8e631a403312:~$
```

When the SSH tunnel is open, you can access the instance using the address `localhost:6379`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to close the session by running <code>exit</code>.</p>

## <a id="service-keys"></a> Service keys

To gain access to the service manually rather than binding apps to it, you can use service keys.

### <a id="create-a-service-key"></a> Creating a Service Key

To create a key to the service instance `redis1` called `mykey`, run the following command:

```bash
cf create-service-key redis1 mykey
```

### <a id="listing-service-keys"></a> Listing Service Keys

To list all the keys for the `redis1` service instance, run the following command:

```bash
cf service-keys redis1
```

### <a id="accessing-service-keys"></a> Accessing Service Keys

To obtain the key `mykey` from the `redis1` service instance, run the following command:

```bash
cf service-key redis1 mykey
```

### <a id="deleting-service-keys"></a> Deleting Service Keys

To delete the key `mykey` from the service instance `redis1`, run the following command:

```bash
cf delete-service-key redis1 mykey
```
