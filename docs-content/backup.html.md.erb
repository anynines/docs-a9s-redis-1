## <a id='trigger-backups-and-restore'></a> Trigger Backups and Restores on Demand for Service Instances

PCF administrators can interact with the Backup Manager endpoints to trigger immediate backups and restore backups.

To back up, do the following:

1. Navigate to the **Status** tab of the tile and record the IP address of one of the a9s Ancillary Service instances.

    <%= image_tag("status_tab.png", width: 300) %>

1. On the **Credentials** tab, find the credentials of the service under **Backup Manager Password**.

1. Trigger a backup on all instances by calling the **/backup\_agent/backup\_all** endpoint:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/backup\_all -d {}
</pre>
or on a given instance with its GUID by calling the **/backup\_agent/backup**
endpoint:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/backup -d "instance\_guid=1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9"
</pre>

To restore, do the following:

1. Find the ID of the Backup and the ID of the instance by listing the instances:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/instances
</pre>
This command outputs an array composed of objects like this one:
<pre class="terminal">
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
      "backup\_agent\_task": {
        "updated\_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:31.389Z",
        "created\_at": "2017-05-19T09:01:16.064Z",
        "status": "done",
        "task\_id": 5,
        "id": 5
      },
      "instance\_id": 1,
      "id": 5
    }
  ],
  "instance\_id": "1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9",
  "id": 1
}
</pre>
In the example above, backups and restores that have been performed for
the instance with the instance\_id `1c16933a-892f-4fe0-b968-ea0bf90246c9`.
This ID corresponds to the instance GUID from PCF.

1. Restore the backup by calling the **/backup\_agent/restores**
endpoint with the backup\_id and instance\_id as data:
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup\_agent/restores -d "backup\_id=5" -d "instance\_id=1"
</pre>

## <a id='a9s-pg-backup'></a> a9s-pg Backup

The a9s-pg backup can be handled with the a9s Backup Manager in the same way the backup of service instances can be handled.

### <a id='a9s-pg-backup-limitations'></a> Limitations

Because of the reason that `a9s-pg` is the main database for the a9s Backup Manager and all services around a9s Elasticsearch for PCF the consistency of the backup information of a9s-pg is not guaranteed:

- Restores of a9s-pg can not be stored in the database because at the time the restore is running the database where the restore information is stored is gone and will be restored to a previous point in time.
- All backups that have been triggered after the backup which is restored are not longer known in the database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be aware that restoring the a9s-pg to a previous point in time means you possibly loose information about deployed instances which results in ghost instances that can't not any longer be handled by the a9s Service Broker and a9s Deployer.</p>

### <a id='a9s-pg-backup-trigger-a-backup'></a> Trigger a Backup

Obtain the credentials and the IP address of the Bckup Manager, see <a href="#trigger-backups-and-restore">Trigger Backups and Restores on Demand</a> for instructions.

Curl the `backup_agent/backup` API endpoint of the a9s Backup Manager.

```bash
$ curl http://backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/backup -d "instance_guid=a9s-pg"
{"message":"job to backup is queued"}
```

You can get the state of the backup by curling the `instances/a9s-pg` endpoint of the backup manager.

```bash
$ curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/instances/a9s-pg
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  9906    0  9906    0     0   3691      0 --:--:--  0:00:02 --:--:--  3690
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
      "backup_agent_task": {
        "msg": null,
        "updated_at": "2018-11-22T04:01:28.853Z",
        "created_at": "2018-11-22T04:00:15.718Z",
        "status": "done",
        "task_id": 148,
        "id": 156
      },
      "is_downloadable": false,
      "size": 44985152,
      "backup_id": "a9s-pg-1542859215559",
      "instance_id": 38,
      "id": 148
    }
  ],
  "instance_id": "a9s-pg",
  "id": 38
}
```

The status flag `"backups.backup_agent_task.status"` can have the values
  * `"done"` when the backup is finished
  * `"running"` when the backup is running
  * `"queued"` while the backup is only queued
  * `"failed"` once the backup failed
  * `"deleted"` when the backup has been deleted.

### <a id='a9s-pg-backup-restore-a-backup'></a> Restore a backup

Use the `backup_agent/restores` endpoint to restore a backup.
You need the `instance_id` and the `backup_id` (given as id) from the backup you
wish to restore. To get these information you need to curl the `instances/a9s-pg`
endpoint before, see [Trigger a backup](backup.html#a9s-pg-backup-trigger-a-backup).

```json
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
...
      "instance_id": 38,
      "id": 148
...
    }
  ]
}
```

Then trigger the restore:
```
$curl backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/restores -d "backup_id=148" -d "instance_id=38"
{"restore_id":5}
```

During the restore of the a9s-pg the a9s Backup Manager is not available and can't be used to see the state of the restore process, see also [Limitations](backup.html#limitations).
You can watch the backup-agent logs of the a9s-pg master node to see the state.
On the VM itself you can use the following command:

```
$ tail -f /var/vcap/sys/log/backup-agent/production.log
```
