This topic describes how to install and configure a9s Redis.


## <a id='install'></a> Install a9s Redis

To install a9s Redis, do the following:

1. Download the product file from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-redis).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Click **Add** or **+** (depending on the PCF version) next to the uploaded a9s Redis tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

1. Click the new tile, then click **Settings** to review the configuration settings for each tab.
  For more information on how to configure the properties on each side-tab, see the following:
* [Assign AZs and Networks](installing.html#azs)
* [Plan Configuration](installing.html#plan-configuration)
* [Backup Configuration](installing.html#backup_configuration)
* [Service Configuration](installing.html#service_configuration)
* [Management Cluster](installing.html#management)
* [Configure BOSH Errands](installing.html#errands)
* [Configure Resources](installing.html#resource-config)

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

After you install the a9s Redis, it is available in the list of Marketplace services. For more information, see [Using a9s Redis for PCF](./using.html).

### <a id="azs"></a> Assign AZs and Networks

Use **Assign AZs and Networks** to configure the location of service component and service instance jobs. Configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

<%= image_tag("assign_azs_and_networks.png") %>

### <a id="plan-configuration"></a> Plan Configuration

1. Define the AZ placement where the service instances will be deployed.

1. Define the VM and persistent disk types.

VM and persistent disk types will be used in the service instance deployments. Disk size and VM size (CPUs and memory) can be configured independently to create your desired plans. However, consider that moving from a larger disk to a smaller disk is likely to fail.

#### <a id='min-reqs'></a> Minimum System Requirements

| Disk nano | 2&nbsp;GB |
| Disk small | 4&nbsp;GB |
| Disk medium | 10&nbsp;GB |
| Disk large | 30&nbsp;GB |
| VM nano | 1 CPU, 1&nbsp;GB RAM, 4&nbsp;GB Disk |
| VM small | 1 CPU, 2&nbsp;GB RAM, 4&nbsp;GB Disk |
| VM medium | 2 CPU, 4&nbsp;GB RAM, 8&nbsp;GB Disk |
| VM large | 4 CPU, 8&nbsp;GB RAM, 30&nbsp;GB Disk |

### <a id="backup_configuration"></a> Backup Configuration

Use **Backup Configuration** to configure the backup endpoints. You can choose between a S3 compliant endpoint and an Azure blob store.

### <a id="service_configuration"></a>Service Configuration

On the Service Configuration page, you can set default endpoints for Graphite and syslog.
For example, you might use `logs.papertrail.com:44456` for the syslog endpoint.

<table class="nice">
  <th>Field</th>

#### <a id='enable_bosh_dns_handler'></a> Enable BOSH DNS Handler

Enable BOSH DNS Handler for name resolving a9s services within the diego cells. Read the installatiion instructions carefully before you enable the feature you can find <a href="name-resolving.html#name-resolving-with-a9s-bosh-dns-handler">here</a>.

### <a id='errands'></a> Configure Errands

Use **Errands** to configure the lifecycle errands that run when you install or uninstall a9s Redis. The list below describes each errand. For more information, see [Understanding Lifecycle Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html).

<%= image_tag("errands.png") %>

#### <a id='post-deploy'></a> Post-Deploy Errands

* **Run Template Uploader**: This errand is required to configure generic components that are included in a9s Redis with Redis  configurations. Disabling this errand may speed up the deployment of all tiles.
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To ensure your configuration remains up-to-date, disable this errand only when necessary.</p>

* **Run Broker Registrar**: This errand registers the a9s Redis service broker at the Elastic Runtime. This makes the service available in the Marketplace.

* **Run Smoke Tests**: This errand runs a series of basic tests against your a9s Redis installation to ensure that it is configured properly. Those tests may take a while, probably over 30 minutes.

#### <a id='pre-delete'></a> Pre-Delete Errands

* **Delete all a9s Redis instances**: This errand deletes all a9s Redis instances which were created with `cf create-service` by PCF end users.
<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> This is an absoutly destructive task and cannot be undone. All VMs of the service instances will be deleted irrecoverably. In the case a service instance is bound to an app or service keys are existing, the errand will fail.</p>

* **Run Broker Deregistrar**: This deregisters the a9s Redis service broker in Pivotal Application Services. This errand removes the Redis service from the Marketplace.

### <a id='resource-config'></a> Configure Resources

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs that host the a9s Redis components. This configuration does not cover the dedicated Redis instances that run on VMs provided. For more information, see [Configure Service Plan VMs](installing.html#plan-configuration).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> anynines recommends using a VM type of large or greater to support the tile compilation.</p>
