## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

a9s Redis for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Redis servers and clusters.<br />
a9s Redis for PCF is part of a number of a9s Data Services available in one Bundle. Visit the [anynines website](https://www.anynines.com/) for more details. Developers can create instances of a Redis server or cluster using Apps Manager.

When you run the cf CLI `create-service a9s-redis` command, PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

Redis service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated. This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of service instances is not limited by design.

### <a id='current-features'></a> Current Features

The current version of a9s Redis for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **On-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Redis for PCF deploys Redis instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM Redis server using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Redis server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Redis for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized apps.
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Redis for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU, and storage capacity for your Redis instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Redis service instance provides log messages and Redis-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/Graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Redis for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. |
| **Customazible Snapshots** | a9s Redis for PCF supports RDB persistence with point-in-time snapshots.<br />This setting can be [changed by the user](./using.html#redis-persitence). |
| **High Availability** | a9s Redis for PCF ensures high-availability using [Redis Sentinel](./using.html#redis-sentinel).<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. The user can modify Sentinel related settings like min\_slaves\_max\_lag and down\_after\_milliseconds. |
| **Improved Memory Handling** | a9s Redis for PCF suports now a better memory handling. In addition, the user can modify the [maxmemory_policy](./using.html#redis-memory-policy). |
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides a single sign on and lets the user easily trigger backups. |
| **Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instances which is greated by the end user. |
| **Consul Domain configurable** | The consul domain can now be configured. |
| **BOSH DNS Handler** | a9s BOSH DNS handler added to make a9s service instances accessible from diego cells. |
| **a9s-pg Backup** | Added backup option for a9s-pg. |
| **Instance Sharing** | a9s Redis no supports instance sharing between orgs an spaces, see [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html). |
| **Update Xenial** | Update to ubuntu xenial stemcells. |
